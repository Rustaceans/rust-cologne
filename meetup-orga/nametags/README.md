# How to use our nametags

## Printing

- Install the [source-sans-pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/releases/latest) font for correct prints
- Use **borderless printing** on DIN A4 **without overscan**

## Editing

- The SVG file contains 8 nametags. All but one nametag are **shallow clones** and not editable. You can only edit the original nametag, which is the bottom left one. All other clones will be updated immediately.
- Don't forget to **export to a new PDF** and check the result.
