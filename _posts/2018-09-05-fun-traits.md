    People coming from other languages can find a lot of familiar aspects in Rust's traits:
    Traits are somewhat like interfaces, and also somewhat like type classes, and also likeâ€¦ classes?
    This talk will try to give you an overview of what traits are
    and how you can use them to make your code more concise and flexible.
- title: "Fn traits"
  speaker:
    name: "Florian Zeitz"

    This talk will explain
    how you can use the `Fn*` traits
    to properly accept functions and closures as function parameters,
    as well as give an overview of which closures implement which traits.

We're happy to announce that on **Wednesday, September 5, 2018** at **19:15**, we are back at the ThoughtWorks office in Cologne!

The theme of the evening is traits
-- one of the core building blocks of abstractions in Rust.
The first talk is about traits in general, showing you how to use them to make your code generic and composable.
The second talk will present the `Fn` traits in detail.
It will explain how you can properly accept functions and closures as function parameters,
as well as give an overview of which closures implement which traits.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/RustCologne/events/vnwndpyxmbhb/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Pascal and Florian

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
