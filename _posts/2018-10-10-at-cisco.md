    I'll take some time to explain what is Wayland and why it's here to stay.
    Then, I'll give a high level overview of the state of Rust on Wayland: how to
    write servers and clients, and how far along we can get with Rust. I want to
    focus on [Smithay projects](https://github.com/Smithay/), and
    [wlroots-rs](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs).

This time around, we are happy to invite you to new location:
The Cisco office Cologne, near Heumarkt.

## Agenda

We'll start the evening with a quick introduction round (if you have a good idea
to make this more interesting please talk to the organizers at the beginning
of the event.)

Then, Dorota will talk about Wayland, the display server (protocol) for Linux
desktops, and how to use Rust to write compositors and clients for it.

Afterwards, it's all up to you: Have an interesting piece of code you want to
discuss? Want some help fighting the borrow checker? You are very welcome to
stay, enjoy some drinks, meet nice people, and discuss all things Rust!

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)
