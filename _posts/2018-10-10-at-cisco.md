This time around, we are happy to invite you to new location:
The Cisco office Cologne, near Heumarkt.

For now, we've planned an **open space** style Meetup. Imagine a bazaar, where
you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find
interesting. It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet
nice people and discuss about Rust.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the
beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

Your help is welcome: We are always looking for talks - just send us your idea! :-)
