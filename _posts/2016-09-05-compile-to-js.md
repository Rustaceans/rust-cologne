After Jan-Erik's talk, we will try to do a **special hands-on** where you will be able to compile a hello world style program from Rust to JavaScript and run it in your browser (bring your own device, requires Docker to run).

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the meetup and may switch to English if needed.
