Happy new year everyone!
Starting of this new decade of Rust our next meetup will be on
**Monday, January 13th, 2020** at **19:15**,

We'll have a look at programming Rust in practice by writing some toy programs.
In the process we'll learn about common traits and design patterns in Rust.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
