Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2022-12-07, 19:15 CET**.

We will give you an introduction to some new features around the 1.65 release.

The most notable feature will be Generic Associated Types (GAT) which allows using generic type parameters in traits.
Another new language feature is `let â€¦ else`, which allows writing certain `if let`-patterns in a more readable manner.
The last feature we'll be talking about is the ability to `break` from a block with a return value.

After this rather theoretical agenda item we'll head over to something more practical:  As a preparation for Christmas we'll have a look at this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) from a Rustacean's perspective.

As always, you can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/290084307/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian and Kai

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

Due to COVID-19 still being around there are some precautions we feel are necessary to make everyone at ease.

We have restricted the maximum number of participants to ensure social distancing is possible.
Accordingly we need to know how many people will attend the meetup.
Please make sure to register and, in case you are no longer able to attend, cancel your registration.

Additionally we generally expect participants to wear masks. During warm weather the venue allows for
decent ventilation. In this case participants may **unanimously** decide masking is not necessary.
