  abstract: |
    Rust is a modern programming language that combines performance and
    security. It is close to the system and offers powerful abstractions that
    are strongly reminiscent of dynamic languages such as Ruby or Python. Rust
    offers memory security without a garbage collector and makes low-level
    programming easier and safer. We discuss possible use-cases for web
    assembly, cloud computing and more.

- title: "Rust's Ownership Model"
  speaker:
    name: "Florian Zeitz"
    twitter: florob
    github: florob
  abstract: |
    Rust is a language with many promisses. No use-after free, no iterator
    invalidation, no data races and generally memory safety. Somewhat
    surprisingly all of these originate from the same set of rules,
    Rust's ownership system.
    This talk will give a gentle introduction into the basic concept,
    while still trying to clear up the common confusions about ownership and
    the lifetime system.

Dear Rustaceans,

we're happy to announce that our next meetup will be on **Wednesday, February 5th, 2020** at **19:15**!

The new year has just started and for many it is a time to start learning a new programming language.
For others it is a time get reacquainted with a language they rarely use.

To this end we'll have two beginner level talks about Rust.
Matthias Endler will kick us off with a gentle introduction into Rust.
Following that Florian Zeitz will talk about one of Rust's main selling points, its ownership system.

Afterwards there will still be time for socializing and open discussion over some drinks.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian

The meetup will likely be held in English, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to German if desired.
