    Rust 1.36 introduced a stable version of the `Future` trait into libstd.
    Now Rust 1.39 has introduced stable `async fn` and `.await` syntax making use
    of the `Future` trait easy and convenient. Traits and syntaxes aren't useful on their
    own though. We still need implementations and users. This talk will give an
    introduce how concepts like `Future`, `async`, `await`, executors, etc. work together and
    provide a quick overview of the existing ecosystem.

Join us on **Wednesday, December 4, 2019** at the C4 to celebrate the coming and of the year
and the advent of async/await in Rust!

Shortly after our last meetup Rust 1.39 was [released] as the first release to support
`async` and `.await` syntax. This was the last step towards [convenient asynchronous programming] in stable Rust.

[released]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Rust-1.39.0.html
[convenient asynchronous programming]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html

To celebrate we'll have gl√ºhwein as well as other hot and cold beverages.
There will also be a short talk introducing async/await in some detail.

We are looking forward to seeing you!

Yours,
Florian

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
