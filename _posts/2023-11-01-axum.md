Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2023-11-01, 19:15 CET**.

In this Meetup grouvie will give us an introduction to the web application framework **axum**. First we'll learn how to set up a basic web application in the tradition of a _Hello, World!_ implementation. The second part will cover the creation of a simple ticket system to set a base for real-world applications.

As usual, the remaining time will be available for talking about random topics. It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/296540949/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Kai and Florian
