Join our **open space** style meetup on the first Wednesday of October, 2016-10-05.

Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting. It all depends on your interests.

Some possible activities and topics have already been suggested in advance:

* IDE support and best practice configurations
* group code review of a WIP project
* ... your suggestion?

We will have timeslots of 30 minutes to allow you to engage in different discussions. :-)
 
We are looking forward to seeing you. As always you can enjoy some drinks and get to know other nice people interested in Rust.

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
