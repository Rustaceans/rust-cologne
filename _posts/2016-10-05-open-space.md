We would like to try an **open space** style meetup in October, as suggested by @carlberger and discussed during our last meetup. Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and activities and spontaneously join any activity you find interesting. It all depends on your interests.

Feel free to make your suggestions [here in advance](https://github.com/Rustaceans/rust-cologne/issues/7) or at the meetup itself. :-)

Some possible activities and topics that were mentioned at the last meetup:

* IDE support and best practice configurations
* Code review
* ...

We will probably include a short summary of the suggestions in our final meetup invitation to give undecided people a rough idea what to expect.
