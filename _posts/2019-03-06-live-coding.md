Our next meetup will be on **Wednesday, March 6, 2019** at 19:15!
This time around we'll do some live-coding in a group with one (alternating) coder.

Generally we'll focus on small simple tasks; porting small scripts, code katas,
AdventOfCode, Project Euler, …
Feel free to suggest your own tasks at the meetup.

This meetup will have an explicit focus on being beginner friendly.
We'll try to explain everything we write and answer questions.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/RustCologne/events/vnwndpyzfbjb/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. ☺

Yours,
Florian

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
