Dear Rustaceans,

deviating from our usual schedule this month's meetup will take place on
**Sunday, March 8th, 2020** at **16:00**.

After a short introduction round we'll have an open-ended hack and learn session.
Join us for an open round of hacking and learning Rust. Find help getting started with Rust,
work on your latest Rust project, or pair up to solve some Katas.

We are looking forward to seeing you â˜º.
