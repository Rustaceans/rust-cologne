Let's get together and hack on some brand new Rust macros, shall we? :-)

With Rust 1.15 scheduled for early February, the highly anticipated procedural
macros 1.1 (aka custom derives) are finally going to be stable.

Agenda

* A short introduction to macros 1.1
* Peer up (optional)
* Pick a project and start hacking\*

\* If you are unfamiliar with Rust itself or procedural macros in Rust, you
are welcome to start with a small toy project, work in a group, and ask fellow
Rustaceans for guidance!

As always, you can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning
of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

*Update:* This time around, our introduction included the chance for everyone to present one 'pick', i.e., something they enjoyed recently. Colin transcribed our picks [here](https://github.com/Rustaceans/rust-cologne/issues/22#issuecomment-276780833). Thanks!
