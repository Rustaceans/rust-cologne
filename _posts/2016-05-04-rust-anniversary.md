This meetup will be (almost) one year after the release of Rust 1.0.

We will begin the evening with a short recap of what has happened on the way from 1.0 to 1.8. Exciting stuff!

After that, we will have a short session of "introduce yourself" (probably followed by "let's fetch some drinks").

What follows then is entirely up to you: You can bring your current projects, questions, and ideas – or just be there and enjoy inspiring conversations with other Rustaceans!

Oh, and: There might be a Rust birthday cake!

PS: Don't forget to bring any equipment you need to be ready to write (and compile) some Rust!

PPS: The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the meetup and may switch to English if needed.
