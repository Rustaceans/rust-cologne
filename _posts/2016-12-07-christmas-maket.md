Dear Rustaceans,

The year is coming to an end, and it is time to announce our last meetup for 2016. Actually, no, scratch that: "Last meetup" sounds so… final and not like the grand conclusion of an awesome year full of exciting Rust-related stuff! Let's instead do something hopeful, advent-y, and surprisingly traditional: An evening at the christmas market. Think of it as `impl Glühwein for RustCologne` (actually part of a generic impl that also includes other holiday-y beverages like hot cocoa).

We invite you all to join us for a casual evening at Cologne's Weihnachtsmarkt im Stadtgarten. We'll meet at around 7pm next Wednesday, December 7th, 2016, at the entrance at Venloer Straße, and head in together. The christmas market closes at 21:30, but we're open to go to a pub or somewhere else afterwards.

Whether you come for hot punch, Rust, non-alcoholic beverages, cheesy christmas presents, good company, or Currywurst – we're looking forward to seeing you there!

Yours,

Jan-Erik, Pascal, Florian, and Colin

PS: If you're running late or need help with directions, feel free to email/tweet us/one of the organizers, we'll answer as quickly as possible, or give you a call if you prefer.
