Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2023-08-09, 19:15 CEST**.

This time, we'll help the [basic-computer-games](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games) project to translate some _very old_ games into Rust. We'll come up with a reasonable pre-selection, but feel free to pick any game you find approachable. Build a team or code alone - it's your choice. Those games were meant to teach programming to newbies, so very basic knowledge to Rust will be sufficient.

The main challenge (and fun!) will be the culture clash between old BASIC spaghetti code and modern idiomatic Rust.

To participate, it is recommended to bring some notebook with a pre-installed rust toolchain.

As usual, you can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/295225790)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian and Kai
