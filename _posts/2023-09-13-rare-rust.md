Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2023-09-13, 19:15 CEST**.

This September we want to look at the features in Rust that are not used as often.
You may not see them as often, nevertheless you will be happy to know about them when you need them.

Some examples are:
* labeled `break`/`continue`
* higher-kinded types
* pattern matching in unusual places
* path specific visibility
* â€¦

We'll explain a few of them and show example use-cases. If you can think of something that fits the
bill feel free to bring your own examples.

After that we will move to open discussion and mingling.
As usual, you can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/295869748/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Kai and Florian
