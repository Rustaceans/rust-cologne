Join us on **Wednesday, December 5, 2018** at the C4
to celebrate Rust 2018 Eve!
Because the very next day, December 6,
is the official release date for Rust 1.31
-- the first stable version of Rust that gives you access to the 2018 Edition.

*Not sure what "2018 Edition" means?
Check out the post ["What is Rust 2018?"] for a general description,
as well as the [Edition Guide] for an overview of major features since Rust 1.0.*

["What is Rust 2018?"]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/07/27/what-is-rust-2018.html
[Edition Guide]:  https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/edition-guide/rust-2018/index.html

Opening at 19:15, we welcome anyone to join us in discussing Rust and related topics.

We are looking forward to seeing you!

Yours,
Pascal and Florian

The meetup will be held in English, but a lot of attendees understand German, too.
