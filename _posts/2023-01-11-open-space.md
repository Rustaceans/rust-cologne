Dear Rustaceans,

join our next **open space** style Meetup on **Wednesday 2023-01-11, 19:15 CET**.

Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting.
It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/290743458)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Kai and Florian

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

Due to COVID-19 still being around there are some precautions we feel are necessary to make everyone at ease.

We have restricted the maximum number of participants to ensure social distancing is possible.
Accordingly we need to know how many people will attend the meetup.
Please make sure to register and, in case you are no longer able to attend, cancel your registration.

Additionally we generally expect participants to wear masks. During warm weather the venue allows for
decent ventilation. In this case participants may **unanimously** decide masking is not necessary.
