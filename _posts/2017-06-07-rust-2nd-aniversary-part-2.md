Another year has (almost) gone by since Rust's 1.0 release, and we want to celebrate this at our next meetup!

**[We are currently planning this meetup, please help us!](https://github.com/Rustaceans/rust-cologne/issues/31)**

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
