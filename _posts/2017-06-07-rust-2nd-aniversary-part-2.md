Dear Rustaceans!

It is official: It's been two years since Rust's 1.0 release! And that means we
need *two* meetups to celebrate that â€“ good thing we already had a test run for
that last year!

That's why we invite you to join us **on June 7 at 19:15 CEST**!

Our agenda so far is this:

* A short summary of what happened the last year in Rust. If you have something
that really excited you and that you want to share, you are very welcome to do so!
* Florian will talk about Inline Assembly. Rust's support for inline assembly is currently
unstable. The talk will give an overview of the current unstable implementation in Rust,
as well as inline assembly support available in other programming languages.
stabilize would be. This will lead into a discussion about a sensible design for this feature and a way to stabilize this eventually.

Oh, and also, we plan to have some pizza!

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/RustCologne/events/239100643/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours, Jan-Erik, Pascal, Florian and Colin

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
