    Rust promisses Zero-Cost Abstractions. In this talk we'll look at ways to analyze generated code to determine their actual overhead.
---
Our next meetup will be on **Wednesday, February 6, 2019** at the C4!
Opening at 19:15, we welcome anyone to join us in discussing Rust and related topics.

This time around we want to look at Rust's Zero-Cost Abstractions.
Performance more often than not doesn't matter. However, when it does you might want to analyze what your abstractions compile down to.
We'll start the evening off with a talk about analyzing generated code at different levels.
After that we'll have an open session analyzing our favorite abstractions together.
Do you have a great crate, or abstraction in your own code, but were never quite sure of its overhead?
Bring it along so we can have a look at it.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/RustCologne/events/vnwndpyzdbjb/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. â˜º

Yours,
Florian

The meetup will be held in English, but a lot of attendees will understand German, too.
