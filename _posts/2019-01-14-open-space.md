Happy new year everyone!
We hope you celebrated the new year appropriately.
To give you some time to recover from that we have moved our next meetup a bit later in the month.

Our next **open space** style Meetup will be on **Monday, January 14th, 2019** at **19:15**,

Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting. It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
