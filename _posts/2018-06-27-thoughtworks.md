    'Share Secrets Safely' scratches a particular itch as it provides the tooling required to use GPG in teams with great user experience, while providing all tooling necessary to introduce said shared secrets into their final destination without them ever touching disk. I will particularly highlight the way the project is structured, and tested, showing that 'journey' level testing is now affordable thanks to Rust.

    A central entry point to your current project

Our next Meetup will be on 2018-06-27, 19:15 CET. We are very happy to be
invited to a **new location**: The meetup will be at ThoughtWorks office in Cologne
(Lichtstra√üe 43i -- just 400m from the C4).

In addition to the new location, we're also quite excited to have two talks
prepared for you! the first one, by Sebastian Thiel is an introduction to "Share
Secrets Safely", and present a tool to share secrets within teams to avoid
plain-text secrets. In the second talk, Niko Hellwig will talk about "HUB", a
central entry point to your current project.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/RustCologne/events/vnwndpyxjbjb/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Pascal and Florian

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the
beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
