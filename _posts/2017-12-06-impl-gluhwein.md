Dear fellow lovers of programming languages with lifetimes, fungi, and/or iron oxide,

The time has come to invite you all to our annual Holiday-themed meetup! This year, we are pleased to announce that instead of going to an ~~overcrowded~~ cozy Christmas market, our December meetup will be at our usual location, the C4, on December 6. There, we'll enjoy Glühwein, and self-made (non-alcoholic) punch, as well as the usual Rust discussions. The festivities begin at 7pm and while we do not have a formal dress code, people wearing Santa hats will most likely get their drinks first.

We hope to see you all in December!

Yours,
Jan-Erik, Pascal, Florian and Colin

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed. Depending on the number of attendees and the rate of Glühwein consumption, we may also gradually switch to shorter sentences in whatever language we settled on as the evening progresses.
