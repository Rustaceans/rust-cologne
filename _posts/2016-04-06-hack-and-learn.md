## Program

Our next meetup will be all around **testing**. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and collaboratively solve simple programming problems in rust.

### All you need is:

* some programming skills
* interest in pair programming
* _if possible_: your own notebook with Rust and your favourite editor (because shortcuts, keyboard layouts etc. can differ a lot)
* and since this is a social event (not a competition): good manners as in the Rust [Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html) ;-)

### Detailed Schedule

* Introducing everyone
* Short talk about testing in Rust
* Forming pairs & Assigning problems
* **Round 1** (pairs): Writing test cases for the problem
* Presentation of test cases to the group for feedback on clarity
* (Optional: Switch problems between pairs, to make it more interesting)
* **Round 2** (pairs): Writing implementations, which satisfy the tests
* Presentation and discussion of results

### Other

* We will try to select easy problems, supposed to be solvable in roughly 15-30 minutes by novices with only basic Rust experience.
* Some experienced Rust programmers will act as mentors during the two pair programming rounds. These mentors will not participate in pairs themselves, but answer questions and provide tips.
* If you like to join this meetup, **please let us know** at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Rust-Cologne-Bonn/events/229919455/). We are looking forward to see you. :-)
* The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the meetup and may switch to English if needed.
