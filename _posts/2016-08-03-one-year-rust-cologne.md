This time we will **experiment with Rust's macro system**. You can bring your macro-related problems and questions. 

After that you can feel free to bring up whatever topic interests you.

And as always you can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust in the charming atmosphere of the Chaos Computer Club Cologne.

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the meetup and may switch to English if needed.
