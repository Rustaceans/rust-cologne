This time around we've decided to test something new.
We'll try to solve a set of beginner level tasks, under different constraints:
write it in a functional style, get the shortest source code possible, make it as simple or convoluted as possible, and whatever else comes to mind.
The intend is that under these constraints we'll learn about new language features and library functions, from each other, as well as the documentation.

Depending on participation and experience we'll solve the tasks as one large group, or split up into smaller ones.
So don't be afraid to drop by, even if your very new to Rust. However, even if you're already fairly experienced, there may still be something new to learn.

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

Your help is welcome: We are always looking for talks - just send us your ideas! :-)
