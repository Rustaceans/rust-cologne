- title: "clap - Command Line Argument Parser for Rust"
  speaker:
    name: "Kai Giebeler"
    github: kawogi
  abstract: |
    Have you ever written an application but then didn't find the time to document or sanitize the command
    line arguments? Got tired of parsing all those numbers, IP addresses and giving the user proper
    feedback of what they did wrong? In this short introduction we'll learn how to quickly set up a
    user-friendly command line interface for your Rust application using clap.
- title: "Undefined Behavior and Rust"
  speaker:
    name: "Florian Zeitz"
    twitter: florob
    github: florob
  abstract: |
    Undefined behavior and the nasal demons it invokes are a problem in some systems programming
    languages. Rust is virtually free of it in its safe subset. However, the unsafe subset can
    still invoke undefined behavior. This talk will explore how (unsafe) Rust compares to C in terms
    of its undefined behavior.

Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2023-06-07, 19:15 CET**.

We will have to talks this time around:

- First Kai is going to give a short beginner friendly introduction to the _clap_ crate. A very flexible user-friendly library for command line argument parsing.
- Following that Florian will talk about _undefined behavior_. Undefined behavior is the bane of many C programmers existence. What about Rust though? Particularly its unsafe subset.

Later there will be time for open discussions and questions.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/293905302/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Kai and Florian
