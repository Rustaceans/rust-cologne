Based on the positive feedback in April, we will do another **Crate Polishing
Meetup**.

But this time, we'd like to skip the search for crates and issues: Instead, we
want to use the list of issues (and guidelines!) the Rust Libs Team's new [Libz
Blitz] initiative has created over the last months, and dive right into fixing
and improving code. You can, of course, work in teams.

One bonus for working on these issues: You can win RustFest ZÃ¼rich tickets
(incl. travel and accommodations)! See [the RustFest announcement][rustfest] for
more details.

If you have a suggestion, feel free to comment in our [planning issue].

**[You can register here][meetup]**.

See you soon!

Yours, Jan-Erik, Pascal, Florian and Colin

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the
beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
