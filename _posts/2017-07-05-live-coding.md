Are you new to Rust?

No matter if yes or no, we welcome you to our next meetup!

Matthias Endler is going to pick a beginner-friendly problem
and do some live coding for us. So you can just watch, listen
and ask questions about it.

After that we will have our usual discussions about Rust. You
can bring your questions + problems and see if someone can help.

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however
reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may
switch to English if needed.
