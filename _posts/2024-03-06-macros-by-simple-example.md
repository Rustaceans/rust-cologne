Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2024-03-06, 19:15 CET**.

Florob will give you a introduction on [Macros by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming).
You'll learn how they work, what they are good for and what their limitations are.
We'll talk about the differences to C-macros and other macros techniques Rust has to offer (proc and derive macros).

In the remaining time we'll talk about whatever Rust-related topic you like. It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/299530888/)**

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Kai and Florian
