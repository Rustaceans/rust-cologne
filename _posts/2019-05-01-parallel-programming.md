    In this talk we're going to take a look at the building blocks Rust provides
    to make concurrent/parallel programs easier and safer to write.
    We will take a look at the interactions between its ownership system and the Send/Sync traits,
    how it prevents data races at compile-time and how things can be built on top of those primitives.

Dear Rustaceans,

we're happy to announce that our next meetup will be on **Wednesday, May 1, 2019** at **19:15**!

This time around we'll look into Rust's capabilities surrounding parallel and concurrent programming.
The evening will start of with a talk describing these capabilities and the practical application thereof.
After that we have prepared some beginner to intermediate level exercises in parallel programming which can be solved
alone or in small groups. Help with working these out will be available. We also expect more experienced participants
to support those new to the language.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian

The meetup will likely be held in English, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to German if desired.
