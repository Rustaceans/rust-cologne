## Program

- We will introduce each other briefly
- We will do some live-coding in a group with one (alternating) coder up-front
- It looks like we are going to code a CSV parser and a Rosetta code problem (cf. [rust-rosetta](https://github.com/Hoverbear/rust-rosetta))
- You can enjoy some drinks and meet nice people :)
