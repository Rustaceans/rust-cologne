Rejoice! This month we'll have our 42nd meetup. So fill your towel with topics,
avoid the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, and make your way to our
**open space** style meetup on **Wednesday, July 3rd, 2019** at **19:15**,

What is an open space? Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting. It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)
