Just a week after our last meetup we invite you to join our next **open space** style Meetup at the C4.

Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting.
It all depends on your interests.
You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

Your help is welcome: We are always looking for talks - just send us your ideas! :-)
