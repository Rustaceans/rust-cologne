This time, we want to talk not about the Rust we _currently_ know and love, but about the Rust we want to have next year! And how do we know what will happen in Rust over the next year? (Aside from wild speculation, ~~stainless steel~~ crystal balls, and actual time travel that is.) All significant changes to Rust—the compiler, the language, and the ecosystem—are publicly proposed and discussed in form of RFCs (request for comments). You can find the currently open, as well as all accepted and rejected RFCs in the [rust-lang/rfcs][rfcs] repository.

And there sure are _a lot_ of RFCs! So we'd like to try a slightly new format: We invite _you_ to give lightning talks about specific RFCs. Which ones? You decide. The only requirement is that you need to have fun talking about it! We'll try to have 3 to 5 talks, each one up to 5 minutes longs plus 5 additional minutes for discussion.

If that sounds like something you'd like to do: Awesome! Just comment on [the Github issue for this meetup][gh37], [on meetup.com][meetup] (or contact us some other way) and let us know what you'd like to talk about! :)

**[You can register here][meetup]**.

See you soon!
 
Yours,
Jan-Erik, Pascal, Florian and Colin

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the
beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
