We are pleased to announce another cooperative meetup, this time with the folks of Cologne.rb, the local Ruby user group.
So join us on the _third_ Wednesday in January 2017 at Railslove (Coworking Cologne) for an evening of everything that starts with "Ru"!

PS: The language of this meetup is yet to be decided and will be announced soon (either German or English).

PPS: Did you know that our first ever Rust meetup in Cologne was at this location back in July 2015?
