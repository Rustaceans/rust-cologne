Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2023-07-05, 19:15 CEST**.

With good support for WebAssembly in all major Web-Browsers Rust becomes an option for building single page web applications. The Yew-framework strives to give a composable and interactive, yet type safe interface to the DOM. In his talk Tobias will explain several mechanisms offered by Yew to help you build your next single page application in Rust.

The second part will be all about IDEs. You'll learn how to set up a basic development environment for Rust using neovim or VSCode. Feel free show your own setup and discuss what plug-ins are improving your _developer experience_.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/294483447/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian and Kai
