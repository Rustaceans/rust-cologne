Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2023-12-06, 19:15 CET**.

It's that time again! After talking about news in Rust of the recent weeks, we'll have a look at this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. The first 6 tasks are usually beginner friendly.

Also, there will be `Some(Gluehwein)` (with/out alcohol). You enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/297100007/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian and Kai

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

Accordingly we need to know how many people will attend the meetup.
Please make sure to register and, in case you are no longer able to attend, cancel your registration.
Feel free to privately send us a message if you think that more safety measures are required.
