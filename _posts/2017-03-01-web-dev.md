    "I'll just write a simple API wrapper for that. Give me two hours." Does that sound oddly familiar? Don't be fooled: writing an easy to use, idiomatic abstraction layer is a lot of work - in any language. I want to tell you my story about writing a Slack client in Rust. From documentation to testing and error handling there's a lot of pitfalls to avoid and laughs to share.
- title: "Diesel – Type Safe SQL"

    Better refuel before we get started, this is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" talk—where the audience decides into which rabbit hole(s) we go down. Writing an actual app? Sure! Type system excursions? Always? Or maybe something about our test shenanigans? And of course fields of generated code as far as the eye can see!
