    Better refuel before we get started, this is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" talk—where the audience decides into which rabbit hole(s) we go down. Writing an actual app? Sure! Type system excursions? Always? Or maybe something about our test shenanigans? And of course fields of generated code as far as the eye can see!

We feel like the time is right to have a meetup around web development in Rust.
And we need your help to make it happen!

We are looking for talks and general ideas of activities that would fit that
topic. For example:

- Are you working on a web project?
- Would you like to present a cool library?
- Do you want to tell us about general architecture?

We would love it if you send us an email, comment on Meetup.com, or if you [chime
in on our planning discussion on Github](https://github.com/Rustaceans/rust-cologne/issues/24).

Thank you!
