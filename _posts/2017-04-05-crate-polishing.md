Based on your feedback at the end of the last meetup, we have decided to try a
**Crate Polishing Meetup** this time around. This basically means we will choose a
crate we consider important and try to make it better/nicer to use. Whether that
means adding documentation, examples, or fixing bugs is up to you. Which crate
to polish will be decided at the beginning of the meetup.

If you have a suggestion, feel free to [comment in our planning issue][1]. Don't
be shy to suggest your own crates â€“ it's even better if the maintainer/author is
present!

~~Oh, and before we forget: This is actually a preliminary plan! Do you remember how
last year we had Alex Crichton, a member of the Rust core team, celebrate Rust's
1.0 anniversary [with us][2]? We might have another visitor from the core team in
April this time! We can't make any promises, but will let you know as soon as we
have more details!~~

~~**Update 2017-04-01:** We are very proud to announce that Gary Newvan, member of the Rust core team, and developer at Facepunch Studios, will join us! He spared no expense and effort to come from somewhere in the middle of England to our beautiful city near the Rhine, just to meet us! (And not because he is giving a workshop for a company in the area.)~~

~~So, our new agenda is this: Gary will give a short talk about Building a Community Around Rust (which we are totally a part of), and after that (and some time to ask questions) we'll dive into the orignally planned crate polishing together.~~

**Update 2017-04-02:** ;-)
