Based on your feedback at the end of the last meetup, we have decided to try a
**Crate Polishing Meetup** this time around. This basically means we will choose a
crate we consider important and try to make it better/nicer to use. Whether that
means adding documentation, examples, or fixing bugs is up to you. Which crate
to polish will be decided at the beginning of the meetup.

If you have a suggestion, feel free to [comment in our planning issue][1]. Don't
be shy to suggest your own crates â€“ it's even better if the maintainer/author is
present!
 
Oh, and before we forget: This is actually a preliminary plan! Do you remember how
last year we had Alex Crichton, a member of the Rust core team, celebrate Rust's
1.0 anniversary [with us][2]? We might have another visitor from the core team in
April this time! We can't make any promises, but will let you know as soon as we
have more details!
