Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2022-07-06 19:15 CEST**.

After a very long break we're happy to announce our next Meetup held in person at the C4!

Matthias will give a **talk about WASM**:
> WebAssembly is neither "web" nor "assembly" — but 100% amazing. It is our chance to build a fast, safe, and universal  compilation target for all languages and all platforms. Let me show you why this is cool and how to get started with WebAssembly in Rust; we will also briefly touch on WASI.

Kai will perform some **beginner level interactive coding** implementing a Digital Rain effect in the Terminal (as seen in the Movie _The Matrix_). We'll learn how idiomatic Rust looks like and how `clippy` can teach you to become a better rustacean over time.

Any remaining time will be used as **open space**: Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting. It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/286890733/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian and Kai

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

Due to COVID-19 still being around, bringing a face mask will be necessary. For the same reason we need to know how many people will attend the meetup. Please make sure to register and, in case you are no longer able to attend, cancel your registration. Thank you.
