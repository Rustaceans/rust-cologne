Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2024-02-07, 19:15 CET**.

On the occasion of the [embedded-hal 1.0 release](https://blog.rust-embedded.org/embedded-hal-v1/)
we'll talk about embedded Rust once more.

The embedded-hal presents a common interface for device drivers to use, which most hardware
abstraction layers conform to.
Florob will present some commonly used hardware abstraction layers, the embedded-hal interface,
and how to write and use a driver based around it.
Time permitting there will also be a live demo.

You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/298913201/)**

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Kai and Florian

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
