    Benjamin works on [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate), which uses Rust and Wasm features heavily, running an internal Wasm runtime, and which can be live-upgraded through the connected p2p-network. He'll talk about how this is achieved and what amazing possibilities Rust allows.

On **Wednesday, November 7, 2018** we'll be back at the C4!
Opening at 19:15, we welcome anyone to join is in discussing Rust and related topics.

This time, we have two exciting talks for you.
Luca, FreeBSD port committer, will talk about what it takes to package a Rust project on FreeBSD.
This is followed by Benjamin, who will talk about the substrate project which builds on Rust and Wasm.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/RustCologne/events/vnwndpyxpbkb/)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Pascal and Florian

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the
beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
