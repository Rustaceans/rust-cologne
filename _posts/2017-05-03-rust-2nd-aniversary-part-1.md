Another year has (almost) gone by since Rust's 1.0 release, and we want to celebrate this at our next meetup.

For this meetup we would like to take a look at the features Rust has gained over the course of its existence.
To do this we will discuss various features, either stable or planned, in smaller groups.
What is it exactly? What have you used it for? Are there aspects you're still having problems with?
So bring your favorite Rust feature and let's talk about it!

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
