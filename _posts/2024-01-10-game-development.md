Dear Rustaceans,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2024-01-10, 19:15 CET**.

This time we'll talk about game development in Rust. We'll address questions like:
What are Rust's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to writing a game or an engine?
What parts can be used off-the-shelf and what parts are still in the works?
Which platforms are supported, which are missing?
Are there any notable games written in Rust, yet?

Kai will show a little 3D-demo written in Rust + wgpu which runs natively on the system and in the browser.

Did you try to create a game or an engine on your own? Let us know how it turned out!

You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/298303772/)**

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian and Kai
