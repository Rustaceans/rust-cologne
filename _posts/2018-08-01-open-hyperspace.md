    During a recent Python Hackathon in DÃ¼sseldorf, Matthias somehow managed to
    sneak in some Rust code while writing a fast, safe Python module for encoding
    and decoding JSON. It passes (most of) the Python test suite for the `json`
    module and was unreasonably pleasant to write. Listen carefully as he tells
    the story of a little side-project that got out of hand and how Rust can help
    speed up even the most boring, highly-optimized tasks like parsing file
    formats in the future.

Join us on a warm summer evening on a journey into ~~hyperspace~~ [hyperjson].
That's right, [Matthias] is back to talk with us about a new project of his.

The agenda for the evening will be roughly the following:

- up until 19:15: time to get some cold drinks
- 19:15: a short round of introductions
- 19:30: while Matthias gets set up (the talk will be recorded), you can grab some more (cold) beverages
- 19:40: Matthias' talk about [hyperjson]
- 19:50: short pause to let people get more drinks
- (whenever Matthias stops talking): time to check out what other flavors of cold drinks the C4 has in stock
- rest of the evening: Q&A/open space/getting more drinks

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the
beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.
