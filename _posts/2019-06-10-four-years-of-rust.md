Since our last meetup Rust has turned [4 years old][four] (Rust 1.0 was released May 15th, 2015).
In the meantime a lot has happened: We've seen 35 minor releases, many added features,
and a new [Rust Edition][edition].

At our upcoming meetup we want to celebrate 4 years of Rust, and tell each other about our favorite
language features. Everyone is invited to participate and give a quick lightning talk about their
most beloved Rust feature.
If you're still new to the language and just want to listen in and enjoy a drink, that's fine too.

Talks should be about 5 minutes long, with additional time for discussion afterwards.

The meetup will take place on **Monday, June 10th, 2019** at **19:15**.
This is different from our usual schedule due to a clash of events on the regular date.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian

The meetup will likely be held in English, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to German if desired.
