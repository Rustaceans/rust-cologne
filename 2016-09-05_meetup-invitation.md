# #10: Compiling Rust to your Browser

Our current agenda is:

* **Why I hate garbage collectors** - by Arne Claus
* **Compiling Rust to asmjs** - by Jan-Erik
* **Special hands-on**: After this session you are able to compile something like hello world from rust to javascript and run it in your browser*.
* discussion / informal talk

**\*Note**: This requires Docker to run. There will be a version of play.rust-lang.org that can be used as well.

This meetup will be on **Monday, 2016-09-05** at the Chaos Computer Club Cologne, as usual.
You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the meetup and may switch to English if needed.
