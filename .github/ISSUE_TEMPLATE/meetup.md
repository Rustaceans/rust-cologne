Title: CGN ###: Save The Date

Dear Rustaceans,

our next **open space** style Meetup will be on **Wednesday YYYY-MM-DD, 19:15 CET**.

Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting.
It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](...)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
Florian and Kai

The meetup will likely be held in German, we will however reevaluate this at the beginning of the evening and may switch to English if needed.

COVID-19 measures: We have restricted the maximum number of participants to ensure social distancing is possible.
Accordingly we need to know how many people will attend the meetup.
Please make sure to register and, in case you are no longer able to attend, cancel your registration.
Feel free to privately send us a message if you think that more safety measures are required.
